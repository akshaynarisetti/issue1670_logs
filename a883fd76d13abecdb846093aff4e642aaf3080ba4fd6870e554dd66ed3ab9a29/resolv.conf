# all known uplink DNS servers. This file lists all configured search domains.

# Third party programs should typically not access this file directly, but only
# through the symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a
# different way, replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.

# See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of
# operation for /etc/resolv.conf.
